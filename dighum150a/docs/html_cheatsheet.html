<h1>Here are some Useful HTML Tags</h1>
<h3>At the top of your HTML document, outside of other elements:</h3>
<h4>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h4>
<p>Every HTML document should have this at the top. It tells the browser or other interpreting software the format of
    the document that it is reading. Note that the ! means that the contents of the tag are not displayed or interpreted
    by the browser. It's just a message to the browser.</p>
<h4>&lt;html lang=&ldquo;en&rdquo; /&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</h4>
<p>The &lt;html&gt; tag has to wrap all of the content on your site including the head and body tags. The attribute
    "lang" tells your browser or screen-reader which language the page is in. This will be useful later when you start
    to make pages for multiple languages. You can look up codes for other languages here: <a class="inline_disabled"
        href="https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php</a></p>
<h3>The Header</h3>
<p>The head tag contains information about your page which gets displayed at the top of the browser on some
    computers.&nbsp; This is where you can place metadata which will help archiving software, and search engines access
    your site, as well as anyone else who wants to scrape your site for their own projects. You can also place
    information here which helps your browser or screen-reader to interpret and display the content of your site, like
    the charset metadata.</p>
<h4>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</h4>
<p>This marks the header of the webpage, and you should nestle the following elements inside it.</p>
<h4>&lt;meta charset="utf-8&rdquo; /&gt;</h4>
<p>This meta element tells your browser to use unicode when displaying the characters on the site. Most pages use
    unicode these days, but you can read about the charsets of old here: <a class="inline_disabled"
        href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml</a></p>
<h4>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&rdquo; /&gt;</h4>
<p>This meta element tells your browser to use the whole width of the window or screen for the webpage.</p>
<h4>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</h4>
<p>This meta element provides the title of your website. It may get displayed in the titlebar of your window, or in the
    tab-name if you are using chrome. It usually gets displayed somewhere by the browser and is not optional.</p>
<h4><span>&lt;link </span><span class="html-attribute-name">rel</span><span>="</span><span
        class="html-attribute-value">stylesheet</span><span>" </span><span
        class="html-attribute-name">href</span><span>="</span>mycssfile.css<span>"&gt;</span></h4>
<p><span>You will also place links to any stylesheets (ie. CSS files) you are using in the header of your html document.
        If you are importing javascripts from elsewhere, you will place the url for them in a similar link
        element.</span></p>
<h3>The Body</h3>
<p>All of the content in your page goes under "body", including the part you might think of as resembling a header on a
    newspaper.</p>
<h4>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</h4>
<p>This element is wrapped around all the text, pictures, links, scripts, and everything else in your body.</p>
<h4>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</h4>
<p>Separates the enclosed content from the surroundings by a carriage return. This is how you mark up a paragraph.</p>
<h4>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</h4>
<p>This means the enclosed text is emphasized. Use it for text you might think of as being spoken loudly or slowly.
    Different machines will interpret this differently.</p>
<h4>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</h4>
<h4>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</h4>
<p>These don't have any inherent meaning. They are usually used along with a "class" or "id" attribute to mark a section
    of text so that something special can be done to it. So, for example, if you wanted a particular block of text to
    have a particular style, you can use &lt;div class="mystyle"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; so that you can style the block
    "mystyle" specially in your CSS. You can do similar things with Javascript, such as using the class name to hide a
    block of text inside the aforementioned div until the user clicks a button.</p>
<h4>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</h4>
<p>Use this for the title of your page.</p>
<h4>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; etc...</h4>
<p>Use these to mark chapter headings, subtitles, and subsections of the text on your page.</p>
<h4>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</h4>
<p>An unordered list. This is not only the stuff you'd put bullet points next to in a presentation, but less obvious
    things, like menus and nav bars.</p>
<h4>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</h4>
<p>An ordered list. Both the things you'd want to put numbered items next to in a presentation, but anything that needs
    to be in a specific order. You can reverse the order by using the attribute "reversed", like &lt;ol
    reversed&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</p>
<h4>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</h4>
<p>These are enclosed in ol or ul tags, and are wrapped around items in a the list. Example:</p>
<pre>&lt;ol&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li&gt; This is a list item. &lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;li&gt; This is also a list item. &lt;/li&gt;<br /><br />&lt;/ol&gt;<br /><br /></pre>
<h4>&lt;dl&gt;&lt;/dl&gt;</h4>
<p>This is used to wrap a description list consisting of terms and defintions. Instead of using &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt; in
    your list, use pairs of &lt;dt&gt;This is a term&lt;/dt&gt; and &lt;dd&gt;This is a definition.&lt;/dd&gt;</p>
<h4>&lt;a href="https://link" target="_blank"&gt; This is a link. &lt;/a&gt;</h4>
<p>The "a" element, which stands for "anchor" is usually used with the <strong>href</strong> attribute for links. It can
    be used also with the <strong>target</strong> attribute to tell the browser where to open the new link. Providing
    the value "_blank" to this attribute will open the link in a new tab. Instead of using a URL for the value of HREF,
    you can put an id attribute on any tag and link to that id attribute like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;a href="#Chapter_3"&gt; Chapter 3 &lt;/a&gt;<br /><br />...<br /><br />&lt;h3 id="Chapter_3"&gt; Chapter 3 &lt;/h3&gt;</pre>
<p>This can be a good way to build a table of contents or to link to a specific part of a page.</p>
<h4>&lt;img src="image.jpg" alt="This is alt text for this image." /&gt;</h4>
<p>This is how you insert an image in the page. The alt text should be descriptive. Here are some hints on how to write
    good, accessible alt-text. <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/</a></p>
<h4>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</h4>
<p>This tag means that the enclosed text ought to be emphasized. Use it to draw attention to text that is not
    necessarily more imporant than the surrounding text. Most browsers will put it in italics unless told otherwise by
    CSS.</p>
<h4>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</h4>
<p>Use this to indicate text that is more important than the surrounding text. Most browsers will bold it unless told
    otherwise by CSS.</p>
